 House Price Prediction – Linear Regression
📌 Introduction
This project was my first internship task at SkillCraft Technology, where I built a basic machine learning model to predict house prices. The model uses Linear Regression, a popular algorithm for supervised learning, to estimate prices based on house features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.

🎯 Objectives
Predict house prices using input features

Understand how Linear Regression works

Gain hands-on experience in building and training ML models

Visualize actual vs predicted results to evaluate accuracy

🛠️ Libraries Used
pandas – for data loading and handling

scikit-learn – for building the Linear Regression model

matplotlib – for visualizing predictions

This task helped me understand the machine learning workflow from loading data to evaluating the model, providing a strong foundation for future ML projects.
